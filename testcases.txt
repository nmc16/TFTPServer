Test Cases (Updated for Iteration 5):
=====================================
1) Normal Operation: i) write - working
                     ii) read - working
                     iii) write using errorsim - working
                     iv) read using errorsim - working
                     v) write 512 byte file - working
                     vi) read 512 byte file - working
                     vii) write 512 byte file using errorsim - working
                     viii) read 512 byte file using errorsim - working
                     ix) write large file - NOT WORKING - keeps timing out
                     x) read large file - Sometimes works, sometimes doesnt, might have something to do with wireless connection and timeouts, maybe timeout should be larger?
                     xi) write large file using errorsim - test later, maybe increase timeout
                     xii) read large file using errorsim - test later, maybe increase timeout

2) Edited OP Code: i) Write request ack packet - working
                   ii) write request data packet - working
                   iii) read request ack packet - working
                   iv) read request data packet - working

3) Invalid TID: i) Write request ack packet - working
                ii) write request data packet - working
                iii) read request ack packet - working
                iv) read request data packet - working

4) Invalid Address: i) Write request ack packet - Have to test changing address of sending socket, not sure how that will work
                    ii) write request data packet -
                    iii) read request ack packet -
                    iv) read request data packet -

5) Mode change: i) Read request - Working
                ii) write request - working

6) Packet delayed: i) Write request ack packet - working
                   ii) Write request data packet - Working
                   iii) read request ack packet - working
                   iv) read request data packet - working

7) Duplicate Packet: i) Write request ack packet - working
                     ii) Write request data packet - working
                     iii) read request ack packet - working
                     iv) read request data packet - working

8) Lost Packet: i) Write request packet to server - Working
                ii) write request packet to client - Working
                iii) read request packet to server - Working
                iv) read request packet to client - Working

9) Invalid inputs on Error Sim Thread - working

10) File Already Exists: i) Client - Working
                         ii) Server - Working

11) Protected File: i) Client - Working, but has to send to server before the check is made
                    ii) Server - Working

12) File does not exist: i) Client - Working, but has to send to server before the check is made
                         ii) Server - Working

13) Disk Full: i) Client - Working
               ii) Server - Working

14) Invalid requests: i) Invalid mode - Working
